Project description. Meter Reading using OCR and Neural Networks automates the process of reading meter values (e.g., electricity, gas, water) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and neural networks. Images of meters are captured, preprocessed, and then processed using OCR enhanced by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and interpret numerical values. Neural networks are trained on labeled meter images to handle variations like lighting or orientation, improving accuracy and efficiency. This system reduces human error and enables real-time, large-scale meter reading automation.
